PART – A
1.
Simulate a three nodes point – to – point network with duplex links between them. Set the queue
size and vary the bandwidth and find the number of packets dropped.

2.
Simulate a four node point-to-point network with the links connected as follows:
n0 – n2, n1 – n2 and n2 – n3. Apply TCP agent between n0-n3 and UDP between n1-n3. Apply
relevant applications over TCP and UDP agents changing the parameter and determine the
number of packets sent by TCP / UDP.
